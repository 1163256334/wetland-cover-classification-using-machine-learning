# wetland-cover-classification-using-machine-learning
There are some machine learning algorithms for wetland cover classification, e.g., ANN, RF, VGG
The ANN and RF are implemented in R (3.5.3) software. The VGG is implemented in Pycharm. All codes are run in window system.
Additionally, we provide three auxiliary codes to achive functions of randomly decreasing data size, introducing data noise, and removing features, which can be used to test model's robustness.
Before using the codes, the user should check the correspongding file directory carefully!
